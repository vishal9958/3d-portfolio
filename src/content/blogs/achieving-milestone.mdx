# My Journey: From Student to Developer

Every developer has a starting point. Mine began as a curious student trying to understand how apps and websites actually work. What started with basic concepts slowly turned into real projects, late nights, and a lot of learning.

This blog is a small reflection of my journey so far.

## The Beginning

Like many students, I started with the basics — learning how code works, understanding logic, and experimenting with small programs. At first, everything felt confusing, but curiosity kept pushing me forward.

I explored different areas and slowly found interest in **Android development** and **web technologies**.

## Learning by Building

Instead of just watching tutorials, I focused on building things:

- My first **Android APK**, where I learned about activities, layouts, and app flow  
- Web projects using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js**  
- Creative projects related to **design, branding, and UI**, using tools like Canva and Figma  

Each project taught me something new — not just technically, but also about problem-solving and patience.

## Challenges Along the Way

There were moments when things didn’t work:
- Errors that made no sense  
- Code that broke after a small change  
- Features that took days to figure out  

But every issue solved added confidence. Slowly, I started understanding how real-world development works.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This portfolio is not just a collection of projects.  
It represents:
- My growth as a developer  
- My willingness to learn and adapt  
- My journey from a student to someone who can build real applications  

## What’s Next?

I plan to keep learning, building, and improving:
- More advanced Android apps  
- Better full-stack web projects  
- Cleaner code and better design  

This is just the beginning 🚀

Thanks for reading, and welcome to my journey.
